# Hypertension (High Blood Pressure) Information

## Understanding Blood Pressure
Blood pressure is the force of blood against artery walls. It's measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and recorded as two numbers:
- Systolic pressure (top number): pressure when heart beats
- Diastolic pressure (bottom number): pressure when heart rests

### Blood Pressure Categories
- Normal: Less than 120/80 mmHg
- Elevated: 120-129 systolic and less than 80 diastolic
- Stage 1 Hypertension: 130-139/80-89 mmHg
- Stage 2 Hypertension: 140/90 mmHg or higher
- Hypertensive Crisis: Higher than 180/120 mmHg (seek immediate care)

## Risk Factors
### Controllable Factors
- Diet high in sodium
- Lack of physical activity
- Obesity
- Smoking
- Excessive alcohol consumption
- Stress
- Sleep apnea

### Uncontrollable Factors
- Age (risk increases with age)
- Family history
- Race (higher risk in African Americans)
- Gender (men at higher risk until age 65)

## Symptoms
Hypertension is often called the "silent killer" because it usually has no symptoms until complications develop. Some people may experience:
- Headaches
- Shortness of breath
- Nosebleeds
- Dizziness

## Complications
Untreated hypertension can lead to:
- Heart attack
- Stroke
- Heart failure
- Kidney disease
- Vision problems
- Peripheral artery disease

## Management
### Lifestyle Changes
- Maintain healthy weight
- Exercise regularly (at least 30 minutes most days)
- Eat a healthy diet (DASH diet recommended)
- Limit sodium intake
- Limit alcohol consumption
- Don't smoke
- Manage stress
- Get adequate sleep

### Medications
Various types of blood pressure medications may be prescribed:
- ACE inhibitors
- ARBs (Angiotensin receptor blockers)
- Diuretics
- Beta-blockers
- Calcium channel blockers
